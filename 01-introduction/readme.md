## Definitions

- Program: A set of instructions which performs operations on data
- Data structures: The way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program - When a program is dealing with the data, how will it organize it in the main memory.

- Fisical data structures: they define how the data is **arranged** in the memory
  - array
  - matrices
  - linked lists
- Logical data structures: they define how the data should be **utilized**
  - stack
  - queues
  - tress
  - graph
  - hashing

- Sorting: technics for ordering the data (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, ...)
- Recursion: a technic that relates to problem solving (in opposition to programming). Problem solving relates to mathematics, while in programming we use loops, in math we use recursion. Generally a problem is solved using recursion and, then, when coding it to a programming language we convert it to a loop.
