# taylor function

$f(x) = f(a) + {f(a)(x - a)\over1!} + {f(a)(x - a)^2\over2!} + {f(a)(x - a)^3\over3!} + ...$

## The Taylor series expansion of $e^x$ around the point $a=0$

$$e^x = 1 + {1\times(x)\over1!} + {1\times(x)^2\over2!} + {1\times(x)^3\over3!} + ...$$

$e$ is the *Euler number* (not to be confused with *Euler's constant*), an infinite number related to exponential growth. Its first few digitis are 2,71828. We generaly see it whenever an extremely small change (increment or decrement) is applied an extremely large number of times - for instance if we capitalizate a rate of 1% over a certain value every second during 1 year we would have our original value times 2,71828... by the end of the year.

For $a=0$ the $f(0)$ would be $e^0$ which is 1.

For this case we are seeing, if we were to approximate $e^x$ at a specific value, for instance $e^1$ which is the same as $e$, the higher the number of terms (a term would be $(1)^n \over n!$) we add, the closer we get to the actual value (the euler number):

- 0 term: $e^1 = 1$
- 1 term: $e^1 = 1 + {1^1 \over 1!}$ wich is 2
- 2 terms: $e^1 = 1 + {1^1 \over 1!} + {1^2 \over 2!}$ wich is 2,5
- 3 terms: $e^1 = 1 + {1^1 \over 1!} + {1^2 \over 2!} + {1^3 \over 3!}$ wich is 2,667
- 4 terms: $e^1 = 1 + {1^1 \over 1!} + {1^2 \over 2!} + {1^3 \over 3!} + {1^4 \over 4!}$ wich is 2,708
